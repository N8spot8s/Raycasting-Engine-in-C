## Raycasting Engine

Uses SDL2 to simulate a 3D space on a 2D plane. Can be viewed in first-person with sprites and top-down views.
Debugging features include a terminal that can be used to make save-states and change variables during program execution.

## Features:
- A two-dimensional map that can be traversed by the player in first person
- Customizable sprites that inhabit the world
- A top-down view where the camera can move independently from the player
- A terminal for debugging features, including save states and changing variables
